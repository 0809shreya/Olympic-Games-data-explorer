This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Olympic Games, focusing on data visualization and insights extraction. It leverages data from historical Olympic records to analyze trends such as medal tallies, athlete demographics, country participation over the years, and performance metrics. Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, the project processes and visualizes data to answer questions such as which countries have performed best, the age distribution of medalists, and gender participation trends. This interactive analysis provides a comprehensive look at historical Olympic data, revealing patterns and insights into global athletic achievements.
